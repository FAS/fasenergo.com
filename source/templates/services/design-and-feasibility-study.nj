<p>Design and feasibility study are required when our generators are incorporated into a complex system on a large facility or within an <a href='/solutions'>industry solution</a>. For example, within a project on development of a gas distribution station, a hospital or an office centre. In this case, we offer consultations to an engineer and an architect of the facility and, if required, participate in the design.</p>
<p>We can also help with calculations to conduct a feasibility study and a create a business plan, which require information on generation of electricity and fuel costs, agreeing on the parameters of emissions of harmful substances and gases. We have a vast experience in this sphere gained from the previously implemented projects and industry related solutions.</p>
<p>An owner of a residential house or a small facility, as a rule, does not need such services, because everything is limited to a typical solution.</p>
