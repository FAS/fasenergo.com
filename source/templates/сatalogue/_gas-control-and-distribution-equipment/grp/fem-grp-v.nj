<p>A gas control and distribution unit (GRP) or a distributing control station (DCS) is applied in autonomous gas supply systems and is designed for safe operation of the liquefied petroleum gas (propane/butane and mixtures thereof) consumption systems and heating systems as well as for regulation of pressure within the system.</p>
<p>A distributing control station of FAS GRP/V type has a basic design and is additionally completed with a solenoid valve and a low pressure regulator. A distributing control station is factory-assembled in a steel cabinet. The connection to the station is carried out from the underside of the cabinet using a ¾“ coupling with a pipe conical (R) or cylindrical (G) thread.</p>
